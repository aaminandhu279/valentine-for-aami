# Valentine's Day Website for Aami 💕

A beautiful, interactive Valentine's Day website with an impossible-to-catch "No" button!

## 🎮 Game Features
- **Impossible "No" Button**: The "No" button will ALWAYS move away when Aami tries to click it
- **Progressive Messages**: Different teasing messages based on how many times she tries
- **Always Visible**: The "No" button stays within the interface, never disappears
- **Perfect Game**: She can only win by clicking "Yes"! 😉

## 🚀 How to Start Your Private Server

### Option 1: Easy Start (Windows)
1. Double-click `start_server.bat`
2. The server will start automatically
3. Share the URL shown in the console with Aami

### Option 2: Manual Start
1. Open Command Prompt/Terminal in this folder
2. Run: `python server.py`
3. Share the URL that appears

## 📱 Sharing the Website
- The server will show you a URL like: `http://192.168.1.100:8080`
- Share this URL with Aami (make sure she's on the same WiFi)
- She can open it on her phone, tablet, or computer
- The photos will load perfectly from your local server

## 🎯 How the Game Works
1. Aami sees the question and two buttons
2. When she tries to hover/click "No" - it jumps away!
3. The button stays visible but moves to random positions
4. Messages get more playful as she keeps trying
5. The only way to "win" is to click "Yes"! 💕
